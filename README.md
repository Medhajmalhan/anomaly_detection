# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Project Title

Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection using Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time anomaly detection system that processes a continuous data stream. The primary focus is on identifying unusual patterns using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm, effectively highlighting exceptional values or deviations from normal behavior.

## Objectives

- Implement an algorithm capable of detecting anomalies in streaming data.
- Simulate a data stream with regular patterns, seasonal elements, and noise.
- Develop a real-time mechanism to accurately flag anomalies.
- Create a visualization tool to display both the data stream and detected anomalies.

## Algorithm Explanation

The **Isolation Forest** algorithm is used for anomaly detection. It isolates outliers based on how quickly they can be separated from the rest of the data. This method is effective for high-dimensional data and adapts well to changes in data patterns.

## Installation
